This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.  The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.

“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—­ Want gratitude to you!—­Nobody is equal to you!—­I care for nobody as I do for you!—­Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”

Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.

“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to herself.  “There is nothing to be compared to it.  Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved—­which gives Isabella all her popularity.—­ I have it not—­but I know how to prize and respect it.—­Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.  Dear Harriet!—­I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—­Harriet is worth a hundred such—­And for a wife—­ a sensible man’s wife—­it is invaluable.  I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”
